This will be the primary repo where development of LinkedNYU takes place. 

## Product Vision

Providing fast and convenient experience for NYU student to directly get access to course sources and solve their confusions.

## Description

LinkedNYU provides a platform for students from the same course to find their classmates, share notes with each other and socialize. Previous students from this course can share their experience and help others decide whether to take this course or not. 

In order to provide most convenient and satisfying experience for NYU students, LinkedNYU is supposed to contain following basic functions:

- Searching: 

	Powerful searching tools that will enable students to find their courses based on the course number, name, name of Professor;

	Plugin filter for students to narrow down the results and further help students find the right course.

	Will show courses' status as open, waitlist, or closed.
- Sharing:

	Each course section only opens to students who are taking, or have taken the course before. 

	Each course will have its own exclusive forum for students to communicate. 

	Each course will have its own resource folder, which will collect notes and other resources from volunteer students who have taken the same course before.

- Statistics:

	Courses' historical data will be available to students, which will include average grades, professor rating, workload, etc. All students can voluntarily contribute to this part.
