# Steps on how to run the app lives here

All code goes inside app.js
Do not touch server.js file.
All API's or keys goes inside ".env" file
Front end runs on port 3000 whilst backend runs on port 5000
To make a call to the backend , just specify the url in the front end and you're good to go since I already set up a proxy in front-end(package.json file).
