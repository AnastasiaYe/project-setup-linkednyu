# Steps on how to run the app lives here

All code goes inside controllers and routes folder.
Do not touch server.js / app.js file.
All API's or keys will be inside of .env however , env files are not pushed to repository since they are included in git ignore.
Front end runs on port 3000 whilst backend runs on port 5000
To make a call to the backend , just specify the url in the front end and you're good to go since I already set up a proxy in front-end(package.json file).
